			<section> <p style="font-family: 'Josefin Sans', sans-serif;"> A lot of people think that eating right and exercising is the key to maintaining good health. However, they are wrong. Rafting, the recreational outdoor activity which uses an inflatable raft to navigate a river or other body of water, is actually the key to being a healthy human being. Lets dive a little further into why this adrenaline filled yet relaxing sport is the best thing you can do for yourself. </p> </section> 

		<h3 style="color:rgb(0,51,0); font-family: 'Poiret One', cursive;"> What is Rafting? </h3>
		<p style="font-family: 'Josefin Sans', sans-serif;"> Rafting is often done on whitewater or different degrees of rough water, and generally represents a new and challenging environment for participants. Dealing with risk and the need for teamwork is often a part of the experience.The development of this activity as a leisure sport has become popular since the mid-1970s, evolving from individuals paddling 10 feet rafts with double-bladed paddles to multi-person rafts propelled by single-bladed paddles and steered by a tour guide at the stern. It is considered an extreme sport, and can be fatal. The International Rafting Federation (IRF) is the worldwide body which oversees all aspects of the sport. </p>

		<h3 style="color:rgb(0,51,0); font-family: 'Poiret One', cursive;"> Afraid of rating? Don't be! </h3>
		<p style="font-family: 'Josefin Sans', sans-serif;"> Rafting can be a terrifying sport. You can flip your raft or if you can't swim, perhaps you may drown. However, with proper intrsuction, you can avoid things such as capsizing. Depending on the area, safety regulations covering raft operators may exist in legislation. These range from certification of outfitters, rafts, and raft leaders, to more stringent regulations about equipment and procedures. It is generally advisable to discuss safety measures with a rafting operator before signing on for a trip. The equipment used and the qualifications of the company and raft guides are essential information to be considered. </p>
